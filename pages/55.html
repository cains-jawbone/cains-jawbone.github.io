  The picture of the Old Mill at Bramley, with<br>
  its medlar tree overhanging the water, its<br>
  octagonal brick dovecot, and its sweet water<br>
  grape vine, had not detained me the day<br>
  before. I had groped for my first cigarette of<br>
  the day, eyes hardly open, a few miles on.<br>
  So easily were things forgotten! I found it<br>
  difficult to realise that to-day had once been<br>
  an English holiday, like that other fifth, and<br>
  for much the same reason. James had got off,<br>
  the Earl and his brother Alexander had<br>
  emphatically not. But the whole thing was<br>
  not clear to me, and I doubted if it was to<br>
  anyone. The two smells, of the medlar and<br>
  the vine, had been the two notes of a<br>
  chord, venetian red and peridot, that bit<br>
  one ear gently and the other hard—or<br>
  did I mean loud and tenuous?—a mono-<br>
  tone save for this variation : once it had<br>
  been hard, gentle, hard, hard, gentle, gentle,<br>
  gentle hard. It had been a pretty smell.<br>
