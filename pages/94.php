    Naturally I looked up. And I tell you I found<br>
    it awe-inspiring enough to actually see my<br>
    own name through the window, printed there<br>
    in great letters for the gaze of all and sundry.<br>
    With a blush I concentrated again on Henry,<br>
    and asked myself if his recent activities did or<br>
    did not constitute the darbs. With a final flirt<br>
    at the fringe, the other tapped and scattered<br>
    the saintly ashes. Agriculture was to take<br>
    back her own, it seemed, and I rejoiced to<br>
    have my last night of the bent broad back. I<br>
    couldn’t think why I became suddenly aware<br>
    of Yeats ; and then it came to me : we<br>
    find heartedness among men that ride upon<br>
    horses. It was here, of course, they commem-<br>
    orated Colonel Anthony every year. Good<br>
    luck to him. Really I didn’t like children.<br>
    A little he and she bounced in, half settling on<br>
    my side like sparrows, and devirginating a bag<br>
    of gum prunes as they bounced. How could I<br>
    concentrate? And Henry was waiting for me.<br>
