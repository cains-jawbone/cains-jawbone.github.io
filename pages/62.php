  What should such a man need with such a<br>
  companion, I asked myself. And then I<br>
  thought of Jim’s uncle, Darius Brockley,<br>
  and of the flimsy excuse the Vicar’s niece<br>
  had given when she returned. Yes, I began<br>
  to understand. And I was not sorry to dis-<br>
  sociate the last of the gold from the silver,<br>
  and wait upon events. I stretched out my<br>
  hand and touched a dime shape on the chair<br>
  beside me ; a sleek cat that horribly exulted<br>
  at the touch of my fingers. We were told that<br>
  the human heart was deceitful and desper-<br>
  ately wicked ; what then should be said of<br>
  the human mind? Why, I meant, should I<br>
  have remembered the tale of the Major-<br>
  General in Trafalgar Square on Guy Fawkes<br>
  night, and how the dead man had told it me,<br>
  just an hour before . . . they came to take<br>
  him away? And then how about myself?
  Admittedly I was a warrior, but even I, surely,<br>
  could be a warrior without being a bounder.<br>
