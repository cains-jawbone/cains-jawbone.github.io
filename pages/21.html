    To reckon with Henry! That was never easy.<br>
    Just beyond the laurels, I turned sharply and<br>
    there he was, bending over the body of his<br>
    latest victim. There was blood all about. I<br>
    called to him sharply and he seemed dazed.<br>

    though I did not know if the profession pre-<br>
    scribe it usually as such, a signal wash<br>
    out. But why should this aspect have come<br>

    fountain Ponce de Leon sought, where he who<br>
    drinks is deathless. And he was not so far wrong.<br>
