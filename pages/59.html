  What was it I held in my fingers? Looked<br>
  at in one way it could just be a kea. I would<br>
  give the bird a phoenix chance. I lit a match,<br>
  and the consequences soothed me. Who was<br>
  afraid of the big bad wolf? No one, it seemed.<br>
  His silly bane had now definitely failed. I<br>
  put, at petit d√©jeuner, the cast-iron old object<br>
  on Gelsemium semper-virens. By the by, I<br>
  had a visit on that day from a detective-<br>
  sergeant about a poor fellow who had died<br>
  strangely. My slight experience of detective-<br>
  sergeants is that they have a manner ; but no<br>
  plural. If you use a word of more than two<br>
  syllables to them they think you are laughing<br>
  at them. They are, to that extent, acute.<br>
  Still it was awkward with Trinder about.<br>
  It pleasured me, however, I must confess, to<br>
  think that I was in a position, though the<br>
  opportunity was unlikely, to entertain di-<br>
  vine Xenocrate with an account of it all.<br>
