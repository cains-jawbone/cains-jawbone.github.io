    I rubbed my eyes and massaged my temples<br>
    with pronated finger-tips. Then I fumbled<br>
    two aspirin tablets into my mouth : Noel<br>
    Coward’s King Charles’s Head. I had a very<br>
    bad head. My vis-à-vis hadn’t a bad head,<br>
    now I came to consider it, bowed over the<br>
    documents. It is a very ungentlemanly thing<br>
    to read a private cigarette case. I became a<br>
    trifle abstracted. What, I wondered, would he<br>
    have said about an abstracted will? He might<br>
    answer to the same name as the man who<br>
    sang : “Ah, are you digging on my grave?”<br>
    But a softer fellow I had rarely seen. On<br>
    velvet, yes, on velvet I would have trusted<br>
    him ; but not on cinders, by no means on<br>
    cinders. Yet the keen eyes bent like small<br>
    topaz searchlights over the writing. I would get,<br>
    I felt, what I wanted from this man. But then I<br>
    suddenly remembered the words of the poet :<br>
    <br>
    <span class="poem">The golden one is gone from the banquets,<br>
