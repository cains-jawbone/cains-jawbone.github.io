    After all I might just as easily have been a liter-<br>
    ary bloke, like Jeremy Taylor or Eugène Sue.<br>
    I told myself that all art was one. There might<br>
    be superficial differences in their work, but they<br>
    had, in the words of the old song, gone the same<br>
    way home. When was it? Why, to-day, if I mis<br>
    took not. I felt I must take a grip of my failing,<br>
    in so far, that was, as it distorted the time factor.<br>
    But in that case I knew I was right. To think of<br>
    time—of all that retrospection, to think of to-<br>
    day, and the ages continued henceforward.<br>
    Have you guessed you yourself would not con-<br>
    tinue? Have you dreaded these earth beetles?<br>
    But it occurred to me that to think of time with<br>
    my delight would have got him guessing. I woke<br>
    to the consciousness that I had done very little<br>
    in my life. Not Dolittle but Didlittle. What was a<br>
    did little? Didling, perhaps, or didlet. It was at the<br>
    former that I woke to consciousness that morning.<br>
