    My ears were becoming attuned, and for the<br>
    first time I heard clearly what the woman was<br>
    saying : “Are you going to leave everything to<br>
    me?” she asked, and I could have sworn her<br>
    companion started. Then seeing, or thinking<br>
    he saw, his mistake, he answered : “You must<br>
    do just as you think fit, May.” After all it was<br>
    none of my business. Some fragments of dis-<br>
    jected flesh still lay among the rests of the<br>
    spilled wine. At my sign, Henry stooped and<br>
    made all clean again. And there was no<br>
    immediate call for me to listen further, for there<br>
    came a pause during which both seemed busy<br>
    with their thoughts. And I too thought. The<br>
    voice was like and yet not like that of Janetta<br>
    Sheringham. How we had laughed that day in<br>
    the hay field when John sat on the buttered<br>
    rolls, and we devised games out of straws, and<br>
    we thought the cricket a war-horse, barded and<br>
    chaufroned too, real fairy, with wings all right.<br>
