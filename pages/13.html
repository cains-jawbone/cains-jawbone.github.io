    Rintrah, where has thou hid thy bride?<br>
    Weeps she in desert shades?<br>
    Alas! my Rintrah, bring the lovely jealous<br>
    Ocalythron.<br>

    Then against a possible invasion of my privacy,<br>
    I touched my white cheeks until they blushed.<br>
    My luck was not in. He was a typically farm-<br>
    labourer, with what thy’d call in Bloomsbury<br>
    a Newdigate fringe. Just like that sort of a poet,<br>
    I supposed they’d mean. He anchored himself<br>
    heavily, consciously waving an empty pipe.<br>
    Henry was now stooping over the other body,<br>
    whistling between its teeth. What would I have<br>
    done, I wondered? Really this sort of thing<br>
    was native to me in a way. I wished there<br>
    were water without going for it. I remem-<br>
    bered, of course, that there was a conduit<br>
    dating from 1597 standing here in the market<br>
    place. But that was of little use to me. On the<br>
    whole, I thought I would have as much<br>
    nerve as my dear hero. But one never knew.<br>
