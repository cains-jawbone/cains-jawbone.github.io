    And then with horrid clearness I had seen a<br>
    woman—not actually, if I could trust myself,<br>
    there ; but aiming, directing, inspiring : slim,<br>
    tawny, petulant, self-willed : wanton, but too<br>
    calculated to be more than mistress of herself ;<br>
    the kind that had made England terribly at<br>
    sea. I looked back on my own youth ; I had<br>

        "Thou Art the Man", is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe. The plot
        involves a man wrongfully accused of murdering his uncle Barnabas
        Shuttleworthy, whose corpse is missing. An unnamed narrator finds the
        body, suspects the victim's good friend Charles Goodfellow, and sets
        up an elaborate plot to expose him. The corpse appears to come back to
        life and points to the best friend, exclaiming "Thou art the man!"

    dared to hint that I was going gay. Poor<br>
    lonely little Bat. But it was still the first dog,<br>
    I couldn’t help realising that, after my hus-<br>
    band’s training. Just as I could not help<br>
    realising that, had I a mind to go there, I could<br>
    now get moled and isled on the Selfridge side,<br>
    though by no means in Bond Street. When I<br>
    said means, I meant of course lawful ones. Then<br>
    I remembered Henry’s favourite quotation :<br>
