  The swallow, the bright Homonoea.<br>
  I wondered if I should succeed in hurting the<br>
  girl. But think of her no more. The will was there<br>
  all right. And the wonderful hands at the oppo-<br>
  site side of the table were at work with a caseful<br>
  of strange pens. I sat quite still ; neither in life<br>
  nor letters will I consent to jump about. I<br>
  begin at the beginning, even if you think it<br>
  prosy of me to say so, and go straight through<br>
  to the end. To be born, or at any rate bred, in<br>
  a handbag, whether it had handles or not,<br>
  seems to me to display a contempt for the<br>
  ordinary decencies of family life that reminds<br>
  one of the worst excesses of the French Revolu-<br>
  tion. The man had certainly got into his stride<br>
  at last. The fellow seemed absorbed. It is<br>
  a marvellous gift, I always think. He could<br>
  undoubtedly have written, if heâ€™d had a<br>
  mind, like a Chesterton or a Camoens.<br>
