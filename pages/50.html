    I wondered if I should succeed in hurting the<br>
    girl. But think of her no more. The will was there<br>
    all right. And the wonderful hands at the oppo-<br>
    site side of the table were at work with a caseful<br>
    of strange pens. I sat quite still ; neither in life<br>
    nor letters will I consent to jump about. I<br>
    begin at the beginning, even if you think it<br>
    prosy of me to say so, and go straight through<br>
    to the end. To be born, or at any rate bred, in<br>
    a handbag, whether it had handles or not,<br>
    seems to me to display a contempt for the<br>
    ordinary decencies of family life that reminds<br>
    one of the worst excesses of the French Revolu-<br>
    tion. The man had certainly got into his stride<br>
    at last. The fellow seemed absorbed. It is<br>
    a marvellous gift, I always think. He could<br>
    undoubtedly have written, if heâ€™d had a<br>
    mind, like a <span class="highlight">Chesterton
