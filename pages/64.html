  Needless to say I didn’t know that that was<br>
  the last day. Afterwards I found it terrible<br>
  to look back, and realise that I hadn’t made<br>
  the most of it, or rather of all the little things<br>
  that went to compose it, and the thousands<br>
  that had gone before. I heard him read two<br>
  things about a man and say that he had put<br>
  in his appearance to-day. The quaint, old,<br>
  cruel coxcomb, one was, in his gullet should<br>
  have a hook. And the other called him a<br>
  demure hypocrite or a blockhead. He must<br>
  first torture his postman, the bait, and make<br>
  him carry the letters of Bellerophon. But that<br>
  was too big for me. My people had always<br>
  owned allegiance to the McLeod of that ilk,<br>
  among others. But until he told me about<br>
  it to-day, I never knew that the Great<br>
  Lexicographer had tasted Lotus with him.<br>
  There was that in me which needed the<br>
  exercise of fealty. To give all—as I had<br>
  given all to him—was very bone of my bone.<br>
