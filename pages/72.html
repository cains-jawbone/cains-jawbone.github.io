    Of course I was sorry to say good-bye to old<br>
    Medehamstede ; but it was pleasant to sit down<br>
    and to really find myself alone at last. Those<br>
    emotional times were trying to us all. I felt that<br>
    my lips were paler than I liked ; but a touch<br>
    of Pasquier’s claret soon put me right. Dear old<br>
    Pasquier, I had come across him in Paris, at<br>
    that little place in the Rue de la Harpe, a street<br>
    in which, I have been told, there was a touch of<br>
    orderly room even in the disorderly houses.<br>
    I opened a magazine and looked hastily<br>
    through the last paragraphs of the short<br>
    stories. I was all for love ; but fading out on an<br>
    embrace never appealed to me. The embrace<br>
    in my short stories—and my life was all short<br>
    stories, I had come to think—occurred in the<br>
    first few words. And afterwards the plot. The<br>
    complete novel length looked better. It was<br>
    called Savage Conqueror, and I liked that.<br>
