  For this time being, Henry was drawing to-<br>
  wards a close. I was not sorry. The police were<br>
  after him in no uncertain manner, and it<br>
  seemed impossible for him to ultimately escape<br>
  them. While the flying squad had surrounded<br>
  the house, the locals were thronging the under-<br>
  ground passage, and Wellington Crisp, with<br>
  his assistant and his bulldog, was pouring<br>
  through the concealed panel in the bathroom.<br>
  Instead of adding one more to his crimson list,<br>
  he preferred to trust himself to a limping<br>
  blimp : almost, it seemed, a certain suicide.<br>
  But he might return. One never knew. At least<br>
  my end was reached, and in some comfort.<br>
  Murders were funny things. If he who so<br>
  tragically killed his King, ever reached<br>
  here at all, which is historically more than<br>
  doubtful (alas, poor Richard! alas, poor<br>
  Thomas!) it was certainly not in such ease<br>
  or such good time as I. I collected myself<br>
  and mine, and went out to sniff the new air.<br>
