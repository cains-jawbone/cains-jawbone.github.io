  This is good. She accepts Lover’s Delight<br>
  from me. She has spoken very little ; but she<br>
  urges me to make trial of a Banana Split. Is<br>
  there some esoteric meaning behind the titles?<br>
  Now Ecky passes over to the Dawn. Alex-<br>
  ander’s my name. They ca’d me Ecky when I<br>
  was a boy. Eh, Ecky! Ye’re a awfu’ old man.<br>
  Emotional stuff. Anyway Ecky has disappeared<br>
  in the Dawn. I almost wish I took it. The hard<br>
  stuff, I mean ; but it would ruin my hand.<br>
  Where would my income be if Aquarius were<br>
  to turn Gemini? She tells me a lot, each word<br>
  huskily lisping over that round petulant<br>
  vermilion lower lip, of a doctor friend of hers.<br>
  I have only known her a few minutes ; but I<br>
  hate to think she would change—her voice<br>
  hits a pocket, just like a plane, when she talks<br>
  of him—an honest station between King’s Cross<br>
  and Edinburgh for—what is it?—being’s drone<br>
  pipe, whose nostril turns to blight the strivelled<br>
  stars and thicks the lusty breathing of the sun.<br>
