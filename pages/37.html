  Death’s clumsy fingers, that was the really<br>
  frightful thing : I had seen them, beneath a<br>
  debonair smile, fumbling so long about their<br>
  business. I realised that I would have to do<br>
  something. This time, of course, the male<br>
  incarcerated at the place of Hotspur’s death<br>
  could not hear. I looked across the table to the<br>
  great brimming bowl of yellow jasmine ; young<br>
  Alexander had sent him up the night before<br>
  with an invitation to a private view of the Paulo<br>
  Post Avorticists. Then I glanced at the rococo<br>
  mirror on my left. Well, my parents had seen to<br>
  it, soon after birth, that I should be one ; but I<br>
  had never, save during that week in Malta when<br>
  I met Ronald Firbank and was a trifle jaund-<br>
  iced, been the other. It was terrible to sit there<br>
  with only the table in front of me, and to know<br>
  that murder had been committed. He would—I<br>
  had sensed that—be intrinsicated and con-<br>
  cealed, chamber within chamber ; if I durst<br>
  open the bores, who would believe me?<br>
