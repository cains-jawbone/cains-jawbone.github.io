    Could I be developing a green-eyed streak? I<br>
    investigated the body before me with the aid of<br>
    a powerful glass. At least I always thought of it<br>
    as powerful, because I never could quite under-<br>

    the body as long as possible. At last I was<br>
    satisfied. I measured the distance carefully with<br>
    my eye : a good forty inches, I made it. I<br>
    gathered from his talk that Guido looked his<br>
    last to-day on the sausage place—furtively I<br>
    knew how excellent—and that Kilmarnock<br>
    and Belmerino completely lost their heads.<br>
    But whether or not this was cause and effect I<br>
    couldn’t make out. I wished for the hundredth<br>
    time I had a better brain. Later she was<br>
    wearing the same bow—I loathed bows my-<br>
    self—and that time he found them and<br>
    trimmed the left end. Then he turned what<br>
    he was holding a bit ; so that it pushed its<br>
    way right through. Then he twiddled the<br>
    black knobby thing, and Mr. Hall burst in<br>
    upon us. The knobby thing was black and red.<br>
