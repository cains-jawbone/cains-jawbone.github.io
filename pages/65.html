  I started to read Hardy’s exquisite production,<br>
  and every muscle of my brain was enthralled<br>
  until I came to the end. Just such another must<br>
  have been the Monk Arnulphus when he<br>
  uncorked his ink. His palette gleamed with a<br>
  burnished green as bright as a dragon-fly’s<br>
  skin : his gold-leaf shone like the robe of a<br>
  queen. There could be no slightest doubt.<br>
  I would now be able to reap the harvest. And<br>
  Ruth would have little gleaning. I thought of<br>
  her mother and laughed aloud. All women<br>
  become like their mothers. That is their<br>
  tragedy. No man does. That’s his. I could not<br>
  help echoing Jack’s question : is that clever?
  The Monk Arnulphus, with a dash of Jim the<br>
  Penman. How, I wondered, did I strike him?
  I knew I should like to. His was obviously a<br>
  slow methodical brain, used to pigeon-holing by<br>
  type. In that case, I thought I knew the type :<br>
  learned in a macabre way, even distinguished.<br>
