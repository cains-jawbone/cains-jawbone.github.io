  I sometimes wish, and I wished then, that I<br>
  had the gift of telling, or at least of following,<br>
  a story vividly. Hodge, in the luxury of his first<br>

  fonda in Vera Cruz, and almost saw the young<br>
  fruit merchant laying down his guitar and<br>

  in the incinerator ; that was charred lines on<br>
  Henry. What would he do? We couldn’t stop at<br>
  this point, surely, I thought. But I was wrong.<br>
