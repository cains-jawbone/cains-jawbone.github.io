    The ancient had then sat down among the<br>
    heather to a great dish of brown and swim-<br>
    ming collops. Personally, as far as my stomach<br>
    went, I could not love the deer so much, loved<br>
    I not on a moor, with concomitant Spey<br>
    Royal to drown the taste. Nor was that likely<br>
    to happen in this case. The absence of old<br>
    friends one can endure with equanimity. But<br>
    even a momentary separation from anyone<br>
    to whom one has just been introduced is almost<br>
    unbearable. Circumstances, I thought, as I<br>
    looked over at the man, alter cases. I would<br>
    give the rogue a chance. “Have you a good<br>
    memory?” I asked. “Intermittent but long,”<br>
    he answered. That signed his death warrant.<br>
    Well, signatures were his business. The gold<br>
    was being cleared out of the light ; the remain-<br>
    ing silver was, how shall I say?, unsatisfactory.<br>
    I also had flaunted the panache—it lay at<br>
    that moment beneath my lips—to the public<br>
    without ever having been satisfied with it.<br>
