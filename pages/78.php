    should always have something sensational<br>
    to read in the train. But this memorial of, as<br>
    I thought, a soon to be dead womanâ€™s silly<br>
    wishes, now cleverly guided a little, by a<br>
    stranger if falser hand, was even more so.<br>

    how to forget. Yes, I would have to learn that.<br>
