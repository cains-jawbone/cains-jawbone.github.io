  I was a little consoled for the weeping weather<br>
  by the fact that Gainsborough had gone out<br>
  to-day. And, now I came to think of it, Henry<br>
  had also gone to-day ; poor Henry, who had<br>
  stayed uncomfortably after his meeting with<br>
  Clément yesterday. Henceforth I ask not good<br>
  fortune, I myself am good fortune, I chanted.<br>
  Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no<br>
  more, need nothing, done with indoor com-<br>
  plaints, libraries, querulous criticisms. But<br>
  that would be scanned. Or rather it wouldn’t.<br>
  It didn’t seem to fit. I had woken that morning<br>
  pleasantly near the sea, at yesterday’s capricious<br>
  place of appointment with the man who gave<br>
  me my instructions and all I wanted be-<br>
  side. Did Wodehouse know it, I wondered.<br>
  Of its Earl he had said that he stood gazing<br>
  out over his domain, drooping like a wet<br>
  sock, as was his habit when he had noth-<br>
  ing to prop his spine against. All I wanted<br>
  beside, I had thought. Hadn’t Chesterton<br>
  said something about it’s being hemp at<br>
  both ends? My job might prove him right.<br>
