    At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he<br>
    had been quite specific : less than twenty thou-<br>

    assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act<br>
    of justice at the end of less than a week, and<br>
    then the <mark>glorious stuff galore</mark> for ever. I<br>
    felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least<br>
    I was on my way, for I had come upon the<br>
    major half of a publishing firm ; they had<br>
    always been very good to me, what with Austin<br>
    Freeman, Oppenheim and Mary Roberts<br>
    Rinehart. <span class="highlight">O my mother was loath to have her<br>
    go away, all the week she thought of her, she<br>
    watched for her many a month. And then<br>
    there was a forgotten line. But the red squaw<br>
    never came nor was heard of there again.
