    At my meeting with Clement yesterday, he<br>
    had been quite specific : less than twenty thou-<br>
    sand yards as average—seventeen thousand<br>
    six hundred to be exact—full ration of the<br>
    assassin’s wonderful substance, a little act<br>
    of justice at the end of less than a week, and<br>
    then the glorious stuff galore for ever. I<br>
    felt excellent as I took my second pill. At least<br>
    I was on my way, for I had come upon the<br>
    major half of a publishing firm ; they had<br>
    always been very good to me, what with Austin<br>
    Freeman, Oppenheim and Mary Roberts<br>
    Rinehart. O my mother was loath to have her<br>
    go away, all the week she thought of her, she<br>
    watched for her many a month. And then<br>
    there was a forgotten line. But the red squaw<br>
    never came nor was heard of there again. I<br>
    thought it a pity that Hodder was not there :<br>
    what a sweet name for a village! My signs are<br>
    a rain-proof coat, good shoes. No friend of<br>
    mine takes his ease in my chair. I have no chair.<br>
