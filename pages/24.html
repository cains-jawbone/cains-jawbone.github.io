    Of Cathleen, the daughter of Houlihan.<br>

  <p class="page_story">
    Next day I saw that my suspicions of Caroline<br>
    had been well-founded. This was an infernal<br>
    nuisance ; a Chinese confr√®re of mine might<br>
    even have called it a hellebore. It was annoy-<br>
    ing to share the house with someone who<br>
    reacted to wild jasmine much as he reacted<br>
    to roses. He throve on my roses. To that extent<br>
    I was satisfied with him. Puffing at Gianaclis<br>
    and blowing at myself for a fool, I tried to<br>
    consider my competence, or lack of it. I had<br>
    always thought that to carry the name of<br>
    fourteen popes and two anti-popes meant noth-<br>
    ing to me either way. To share it with Giulio<br>
    de Medici might sound more sinister to the<br>
    uninstructed. At least the quality of mercy was<br>
    little exerted, much less strained, in me. Roses<br>
    automatically reminded me of my aunt Cynthia<br>
    who had, before there was any constraint<br>
    between them, asked the poor old Ahkoond<br>
    of Swat to share a dream nest with her heart<br>
    among these decorative but vestigial flowers.<br>
