    One’s eyebrows were one’s own, I always<br>
    thought. Though I did remember a case—Aunt<br>
    Mary’s, to be precise—when it was not so.<br>
    She had met him after the explosion, of course ;<br>
    and when it became a question of dinner and<br>
    the Highgate Empire, actually with performing<br>
    quaggas, she put herself in the hands of the<br>
    man who made up for, if anything could make<br>
    up for, the Russian ballet. And they dropped,<br>
    naturally, like two fuzzy caterpillars into the clear<br>
    soup at supper. The old days. The High-<br>
    gate Empire, where Wilkie Bard, as Lauder did<br>
    not say, sang o’ his love and fondly sae did I<br>
    o’ mine. At last the two little horrors ceased in<br>
    their shrill claim and counter-claim for sweaty<br>
    quasi-transparencies of colour, and goggled at<br>
    me while I put black to mine. Bill always called<br>
    them two dark flapper moons. Should I<br>
    make an effort and go back to Henry? He<br>
    was ready to love. That at least was obvious.<br>
