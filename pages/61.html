      Broadmoor Hospital is a high-security psychiatric hospital in Crowthorne,

      Some way into the moor stands the town of Princetown, the site of
      Dartmoor Prison. The prison has an incorrect reputation for being
      escape-proof, due to both the buildings themselves and its physical

      The King Chapel Memorial at All Saints Church, Ockham, Surrey. Monument
