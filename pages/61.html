  I had always been proud of my namesake, the<br>
  Great Lexicographer, as we, not unnaturally,<br>
  called him in the family. But I wondered if<br>
  part of my life would not rather horribly<br>
  reverse his. After all he had been born at Colney<br>
  Hatch. But no, for the goal of my pilgrimage<br>
  might easily make it Broadmoor ; I rather<br>
  hated that : portmanteau of Dartmoor and<br>
  Broad arrows, with a little insanity thrown in.<br>
  No, locked in, locked in! William the School-<br>
  man—how like an old war song!—was of that<br>
  place, and, in spite of Rysbrach’s statues of the<br>
  first Lord King, it was charming. <span class="highlight">Le<br>
  couchant dardait ses rayons suprêmes et le<br>
  vent berçait les nénuphars blêmes ; les grands<br>
  nénuphars entre les roseaux tristement luisaient<br>
  sur les calmes eaux.

      Promenade Sentimentale, by Paul Verlaine<br>
      <i>The setting sun cast its final rays<br>
      And the breeze rocked the pale water lilies;<br>
      Among the reeds, the huge water<br>
      Lilies shone sadly on the calm water</i><br>

  </span> Doctor Invincibilis, dear<br>
  old Bill, he was no mean psychologist ; he<br>
  had a razor. There I saw a hen and two<br>
  sheep. It was a pity about Dickens’ insane<br>
  jealousy of chickens, and one could really<br>
  almost weep at his <mark>morbid mistrust</mark> of sheep.<br>
