  Babs now moves across the vision, crowned<br>
  with two straight downfalls, as it were, of<br>
  copper upon her head. The uncurling flow is<br>
  to right and left, as if a river, reflecting a<br>
  thunder sunset, had split in terror into twin<br>
  cataracts. And here, thank heaven, come the<br>
  first, much needed rain of the week. A grey-<br>
  ness and a spray to begin with, and suddenly<br>
  a birth of little silver frogs all along the road.<br>
  We were sitting in the verandah in the dead,<br>
  hot, close air, gasping and praying that the<br>
  black-blue clouds would let down and bring<br>
  the cool. I always think of that, even in<br>
  England. But, looking across at the figure<br>
  opposite me, I realise that it is actually she<br>
  and not Babs that has got me. Got me,<br>
  that is a terrible conjunction of two little<br>
  words ; Henry does not like it at all. But<br>
  as a proof that what I say is true, she is strong<br>
  enough to wean me from my thoughts of<br>
  Orange Pekoe to a Special Orange Supreme.<br>
