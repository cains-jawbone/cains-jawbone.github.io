    While my mind had been thus far away, a<br>
    grotesque looking old gentleman had fluttered<br>
    like a bat to the seat between us, and now<br>
    deposited, with the bitter sang-froid of the<br>
    unworldly, a dilapidated deer-stalker of pinkish<br>
    tweed upon the glacial parquet. I thought I<br>
    knew the type : learned in a macabre way,<br>
    even distinguished ; one who was rich enough<br>
    to remain unspotted by convention, and who<br>
    yet reserved a thousand chariots in full force,<br>
    gold of course, for the undoing of a material-<br>
    istic world. Gathering a fungus in the other<br>
    golden ruin before me, I considered within<br>
    myself what such an obvious hermit could be<br>
    doing among the brilliant lights of this notori-<br>
    ously soigné place. A dog was patently sorrow-<br>
    ing in the distance. The two had their heads<br>
    close together. The poor brute’s howling<br>
    bothered me, and I was glad when it ceased.<br>
    You will, Oscar, you will. Whistler’s jibe I<br>
    had always taken personally. Was all my endea-<br>
    vour to be in the future? Would I never do any-<br>
    thing in the present? It all seemed so fatuous.<br>
