    photographs of young and laughing athletes,<br>
    lads who had profited and gone on, and ringing<br>
    with those words of the Head, as we called him,<br>
    that one by one the touch of life has turned to<br>
    truth. But again I was distracted. “Will<br>
    anyone know about them?” that husky<br>
    miracle of a voice was asking, and I thought,<br>
    not for the first time, that it would have<br>
    caresses for all, a golden impartiality. To love<br>
    her would be a liberal, no, a communist<br>
    education. The red rose and the white only<br>
    remained, and these were melting and blurring<br>
    before my eyes ; my wretched eyes that could<br>
    not tell me the truth, for instance, about that<br>
    Goya reproduction. A hanging man? A count-<br>
    ess? “There is no danger of that,” the old man<br>
    said, “I bought them secretly in Leningrad<br>
    from a little humpbacked fellow, a double-faced<br>
    Quasimodo of the Ogpu.” This was difficult<br>
    enough to reconcile with his Manchester speech<br>
    on sane mediocrity. “From the secret police?”
    The words rang like tense half-crowns dropped<br>
    upon marble. “Goodness gracious!” “But<br>
    it so seldom is,” came the wise old reply.<br>
