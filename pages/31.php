  The others did not seem similarly impressed.<br>
  Phrases of this and that came to half my ear,<br>
  duet by rill and corncrake. Rill vaunted the<br>
  pleasure of speeding, and corncrake gave warn-<br>
  ings like an over-driven oak about to fall. I<br>
  remembered how I had listened for the same<br>
  sound on that awful night in Paris, when I did<br>
  not know what I know now. And again, in<br>
  this very place for another reason, Henry<br>
  would remember. To lose even two like these<br>
  two, swallowed by the night, was apt to break<br>
  a balance in one, to suggest that it was time to<br>
  square accounts. Caseus, ah! And nothing<br>
  lean or hungry here at all. A friend in the<br>
  nick of time. I would have no more. My hand<br>
  dropped to my hip pocket. I had to reckon with<br>
  Henry. Yet could I? This nomenclature busi-<br>
  ness had often bothered me. Sometimes I<br>
  felt sudden enough, as if my head would burst ;<br>
  sometimes but triturative. Was I a bomb,<br>
  or only slow and godly and exceeding small?<br>
