    Compact, they call it ; but when I used it, I<br>
    was feeling anything but so. Don’t think me<br>
    squeamish ; it was my first. The last little<br>
    contact with the bony ankles, so warm and so<br>
    soon, if Nature’s great force were to do its<br>
    work, to be so cold, had touched me, I confess<br>
    it. Though I was alone again, it took me a few<br>
    minutes to visualise Henry’s predicament with<br>
    the detached calm which it deserved. That old<br>
    aunt of his third wife had turned up again.<br>
    Strangely enough a jellyfish had plugged the<br>
    solution of her motor boat’s continuity. And<br>
    there she was back again, alert, suspicious,<br>
    very much alive. I couldn’t help being sorry<br>
    for Henry. And I couldn’t help being sorry for<br>
    Perceval. Murders were funny things. That<br>
    day’s killing of Perceval, and in so public<br>
    a place, seemed to me unwarrantable. But<br>
    I had never been strong on politics. For<br>
    the other, my own, though it was under-<br>
    standable, there was perhaps no utter warrant.<br>
