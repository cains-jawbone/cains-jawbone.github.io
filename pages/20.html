    The best I had done seemed to me blank and<br>
    suspicious, my great thoughts as I supposed<br>
    them, were they not in reality meagre? Next<br>
    day I would have to pay for all I had had of<br>
    solace, and for all I would have later. It would,<br>
    I thought, have seemed impossible to link<br>
    Will’s friend Ben with Will’s wife, and yet<br>
    they went off together, or at least on that same<br>
    day : the bricklayer out of Annandale and<br>
    the inheritor of the second-best bed : strange<br>
    bedfellows. Underneath this stone, he had<br>
    said, doth lie as much Beauty as could die ;<br>
    but of course he hadn’t been talking about<br>
    her. Nor had either had anything to do with<br>
    my waking, my strong tea, and my first pill.<br>
    That all happened by the Mole, and there was<br>
    the oldest brass in England, saying : SIRE :<br>
    IOHAN : DAUBERNOUN : CHIVALER :<br>
    GIST : ICY : DEV : DE : SA : ALME : EYT :<br>
    MERCY. Good enough. We have circled and<br>
    circled till we have arrived home again, we two.<br>
