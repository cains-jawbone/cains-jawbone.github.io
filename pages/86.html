    Next day I let Caroline Jasmine—what a name!
    —do her very damnedest for my guest. But I<br>
    was doubtful of her influence all the while.<br>
    What a man! Henry, I supposed, was about<br>
    his business and concern, such as it was. What<br>
    is removed drops horribly in a pail. Why should<br>
    that stick in my head? Just because a tool<br>
    I have used, and shall use again, turned, as it<br>
    were, under my hand last week and said it?
    And what more had he said? Has anyone<br>
    supposed it lucky to be born? I hasten to<br>
    inform him or her it is just as lucky to die,<br>
    and I know it. That should be, I thought,<br>
    a consolation for my patient. Surely such<br>
    a confirmed old tub-thumper would not<br>
    have had the wit to think out the Mithra-<br>
    dates inoculation for himself, and put it<br>
    into practice? Perish the thought, and the<br>
    fellow. Also my ravishing correspondent would<br>
    have told me. I found myself thinking with<br>
    a strange weakness of the poet’s lines :<br>
    But we have all bent low and low and kissed the<br>
    quiet feet<br>
