    I had gone to sleep the night before after re-<br>
    reading Typhoon. It had always struck me as<br>
    a remarkable work. Now was the hour when<br>
    Charles Victor Hugo Renard-Beinsky had<br>
    risen untimely for the sake of the investigating<br>
    judge. But the very phrase struck chill like the<br>
    slap of the Firth of Forth above the heart,<br>
    wading out over the coal dust in the morning.<br>
    I had investigated ; but who would believe an<br>
    investigator who had not stirred from Baker<br>
    Steet? I was a judge, but with no sombre<br>
    little cap, and no machinery to make my<br>
    judgements effective. I felt I needed some-<br>
    thing. Would I be comforted by a Jewâ€™s lime<br>
    and the concomitant odour? I tried, and felt<br>
    relieved. Someone had advised me, a few days<br>
    before, to read Conrad in search of his Youth, or<br>
    in Search of a Father, was it? But I had always<br>
    found Conrad unreadable, as far from English<br>
    as the Poles, and did not mean to try again.<br>
