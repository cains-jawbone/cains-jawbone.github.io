    I hate seeing things like this in the paper. Bill<br>
    to Solve the Traffic Problem. Bill to improve<br>
    the Secondary Schools. I am never asked. I<br>
    am not qualified. It is all so sudden. I find it<br>

    everything to do with the Wimpole Street<br>
    singer is just now, except perhaps her sing-<br>
    ing. Toll slowly, a match box rhythm. Bryant<br>
    and, of course, May. Rub gently, she is here,<br>

    beat differently. I must say I envy Alexander<br>
    having his first, and perhaps his second, in<br>
    there. I think wistfully of the poet’s lines :<br>
