    The victim, for that I must now reluctantly<br>
    call him, blocked all the sweet air from the<br>
    window. He put out his hand and asked if<br>
    death were so unlike sleep caught this way.<br>
    Sed he. Death’s to fear from flame or steel, I<br>
    sickeningly gathered, or poison doubtless ; but<br>
    from water—feel. Go find the bottom! He was<br>
    asking for it. Was he to be disappointed? Oh,<br>
    yeah. A babbled o’ green fields (sorry, even in<br>
    retrospect the habit is catching) which he could<br>
    not have seen at all well. I pulled up his socks<br>
    for him, and heaved outward with all my<br>
    strength. The window was no more dark. The<br>
    fool, with any luck, was dead. What had he said<br>
    as he finally left me? It sounded like Quails and<br>
    Arty and Fakes. Fakes, Quails and Arty. Band,<br>
    Speckled. No, I could make nothing of that.<br>
    But, thank goodness, I was no detective.<br>
