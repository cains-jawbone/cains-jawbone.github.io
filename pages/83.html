    A flower-seller, fed ruddily, it seemed, on hope,<br>
    broke in and would have made a round of all<br>
    of us. But she hurried away perforce without<br>
    gaining her point, leaving me with an inex-<br>
    pensive memory of countryside flowers. Our<br>
    own and other countries : ironic daffodils,<br>
    irises of the stream, young pert bluebells,<br>
    the foreign hedge-rose and carnation. No<br>
    gaudy melon flower, indeed. Oh, to be in<br>
    England ; how unquotable he had become.<br>
    For I was, was I not? I must learn Spanish<br>
    one of these days, only for that slow sweet<br>
    nameâ€™s sake. I paused to pass my tongue over<br>
    the dew distilled by the red rose, the sole<br>
    survivor, and made a sign which brought<br>
    Henry cat-like to me over the floor. Here the<br>
    old man dropped some metallic object and his<br>
    companion retrieved it with daughterly swift-<br>
    ness. The hoarse newsboys with their shouting<br>
    of the late night final, as of accomplished mal de<br>
    mer, disturbed me a little. Would there be any<br>
    news? She enquired faintly what he meant<br>
    by that stuff about good news from Ghent.<br>
