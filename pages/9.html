    The sound of the bell, as of a boding gnat, just<br>
    came to me. The finger causing it was, I knew,<br>
    the index of a most skilful hand, one I had com-<br>
    manded, one that would pluck me from<br>
    embarrassment, and yet one I vaguely dis-<br>
    trusted. Really, if the lower orders don’t set us<br>
    a good example, what on earth is the use of<br>
    them? They seem, as a class, to have absolutely<br>
    no sense of responsibility. . . . One had to be in<br>
    the key for such things. I felt I should enjoy<br>
    it as I got used to it. The bell again, and<br>
    then a far sensation of feet. I was glad the<br>
    man had come ; time was not unlimited. I<br>
    remembered that, when I was returning after<br>
    a fortnight’s absence during which my assistant<br>
    Charles Day had deputised for me in my lec-<br>
    tures on mineralogy at Peebles University, a<br>
    tactless hand had left on the blackboard :<br>
    “Let us work while it is yet Day ; for the<br>
    Knight cometh when no man can work.”<br>
