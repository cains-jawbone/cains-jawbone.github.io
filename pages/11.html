    If Henry had been there he could have told me<br>
    what to do. His great voice, tuned and broken<br>
    at the capstan bar, would have breezily put<br>
    me right. Tears came to my eyes. I was, I<br>
    supposed, an emotional old fool. So I came back<br>
    and waited in Orchard, it ran through my<br>
    head, where he cast up blinded that night,<br>
    which were my true friend Ravager, which<br>
    were always good to me since we was almost<br>
    <span class="highlight">pups<span class="comment">narrator is a dog</span></span>, and never minded of my short legs.<br>
    Very emotional. But there was no need for me<br>
    to weep just at the end of the second dog, nor<br>
    would I. Henry had taught me a little of his<br>
    trade, and this, curiously enough, was what had<br>
    struck. After all the Grundy Sapphic of yester-<br>
    day had described a more universal taking off<br>
    in Ireland. I did not quite agree with de<br>
    Quincey that murders in Ireland did not count.<br>
    But perhaps it was an optimistic memory<br>
    which told me that such things used not<br>
    to happen when the queer old Dean was alive.<br>
