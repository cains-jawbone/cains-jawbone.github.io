    Then came Hyacinth’s day. He laughed when<br>
    he remembered that, as we were walking round<br>
    the garden, and said it was too late for Jas-<br>
    mine’s day at any rate. I liked to hear him<br>
    laugh, and thought it was absurd for him to be<br>
    called after what the man Boots didn’t under-<br>
    stand. The latter’s way of expressing himself<br>
    seemed to me childish ; why should we, of all<br>
    people, use singular for plural and plural for<br>
    singular? They went back two days and formu-<br>
    lated their bet, till I could have howled. If he<br>
    got the third point, she’d owe him a box of a<br>
    hundred Egyptian cigarettes—Gourdoulis, and<br>
    if she won, he’d give her three pairs of Etam<br>
    dawn mist, ten inches. They looked so bright<br>
    about it all. She drooped long seed pearl things<br>
    right over the soup. Ear-drops, as my mother<br>
    had called them, I never could abide ; prob-<br>
    ably because I belonged to the other side<br>
    of the family. My mistress wore them ; was it for<br>
    that that I had begun to tire of her already?<br>
