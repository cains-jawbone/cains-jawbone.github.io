  Just broken to twine round thy harp-strings, as if<br>
  no wild beat<br>
  Were now raging to torture the desert! Then I,<br>
  as was meet . . .<br>
  I assure you I had not seen her enter ; but sud-<br>
  denly I was electrically aware that she was sit-<br>
  ting near me. What could come next? I had let<br>
  Henry guide me. She was very tall ; sometimes,<br>
  I think, tallness is an excellent thing in women.<br>
  Julienne? Yes, she looked as if her name would<br>
  be of the sort. And I surmised dark eyes under<br>
  golden lashes. I hardly liked to disturb the<br>
  surface for the first time. Her voice purred in<br>
  my quick ears ; I thought of a jaguar on a<br>
  lean bough, and envied Henry. The surface<br>
  was clear brown, and I discerned white<br>
  figures within ; stars, and a little heart, mira-<br>
  bile dictu, were moving inside. She lit a cigar-<br>
  ette and poured down cocktail after cock-<br>
  tail ; sometimes she made little dabbings<br>
  with a butterfly of white lace to her mouth.<br>
