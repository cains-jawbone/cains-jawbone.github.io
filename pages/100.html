    I dimly guess why the old dead so wanted this.<br>
    I had worked for him, Henry had worked for<br>
    him. If I could get up, as, believe me, I cannot,<br>
    I would have a thing to say to her. She lolls<br>
    over at me gloating, her mouth blood-tinted<br>
    on the puma freckle of her beauty. Why<br>
    should I think of Henry at this particular<br>
    juncture? I have it. Scotland Yard, of course.<br>
    And little ’twill matter to one. A sorry thing<br>
    to be last noticed : the buttonhole has escaped<br>
    from the buttonholer. He, the reckless old cock,<br>
    slips down past Woolworth’s and she continues<br>
    full-sail toward the Kursaal, as flush—oh, you<br>
    wicked woman—as May. The girl is smiling<br>
    at me. That’s not so good. Here I shake off<br>
    the bur o’ the world, man’s congregation shun.<br>
    O beastly woman. You know not how ill’s all<br>
    here, about my heart ; but I know. Henry,<br>
    I feel it, is for the first and last time getting out<br>
    of hand. Good-bye, Henry. He drops awa. . . .<br>
