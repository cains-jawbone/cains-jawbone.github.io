  It flashed through my mind that the place<br>
  between Eros and the Queenâ€™s Hall had hor-<br>
  ribly changed since Orpen painted it in 1912,<br>
  also that even if I took the warnings of the<br>
  Ming and got there instantaneously, my<br>
  modest Munich would have to bracket, at my<br>
  expense, with islands more correctly known<br>
  as Efate. But after all I was not going. Rather<br>
  I intended to finish what I had begun. The<br>
  girl would find it in the morning, franked,<br>
  and all ready to go upon its way. I had told<br>
  all I knew, and felt very tired. Would he ignore<br>
  what I had said, leaving me to do my worst?
  And if so, what worst could I do? Or would<br>
  he come to me and cringe for silence, relying<br>
  on our old association, when he had babbled<br>
  at me knee, the arthritic one, that surely the<br>
  cabbage butterflies were fragments of a poem<br>
  God had written and, as being too good for us,<br>
  torn up? Or would he simply try to do me in?
