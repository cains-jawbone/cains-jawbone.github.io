  What chemistry! That the winds are really not<br>
  infectious. Now that I was approaching jour-<br>
  ney’s end, I began to ask myself disconcerting<br>
  questions. It would be terrible if she turned<br>
  out to be Flecker’s one. And some to Flecker<br>
  turn to pray, and I toward thy bed. But I had<br>
  probably got it wrong. Yet it was all right.<br>
  Her spelling was different and it was long ago.<br>
  Yes, but supposing she came of the family of<br>
  Jack’s visitor, with Thornhill, who promised<br>
  the opera? I could never be sure of that. I took<br>
  a pill. But it was worth it. Yes, it was worth it.<br>
  The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould<br>
  in the garden. He certainly could put that<br>
  sort of thing over, the dear old bean. Out<br>
  of its little hill faithfully rise the potato’s<br>
  dark green leaves. Thames Ditton’s sister,<br>
  as Eric Parker calls her—and one remem-<br>
  bered the Irishman’s malapropism in the<br>
  same tale—had soon passed. Long she was ;<br>
  but I did not linger to pay court to her.<br>
