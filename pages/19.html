    Yesterday he got in another of his own kind,<br>
    who agreed she’d done it all herself. He<br>
    twiddled the polished knob and Mr. Hall came<br>
    into the room again. I heard him muttering<br>
    that it was appropriate the Human Comedy<br>
    couldn’t possibly have gone on beyond to-day.<br>
    I, rather surprisingly, liked music. Surprisingly,<br>
    that is, to anyone who did not know that my<br>
    people came from the same place as the<br>
    McCrimmons, that famous race of hereditary<br>
    music makers. I was rather astonished to hear<br>
    him saying something about someone who was<br>
    by virtue first, then choice, a queen. Tell me, if<br>
    she were not design’d th’ eclipse and glory of<br>
    her kind. So I pulled his sleeve. He pulled my<br>
    ears, and said it was Wotton, which I didn’t<br>
    think it was, and that she had only just come to<br>
    Falkland. I made a low noise and at once knew<br>
    I had done the wrong thing. Usually he just<br>
    said William Sydney Porter, which I offended ;<br>
    but then he said something much worse.<br>
