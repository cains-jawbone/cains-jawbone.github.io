  I had sufficient knowledge to realise that I had<br>
  succeeded. I ordered Charles to spare no<br>
  expense in confecting that Sundae known as<br>
  Lover’s Delight for my companion. I believed<br>
  in letting a man have a bit in. A couple of<br>
  hours later the <mark>parson in the pulpit</mark> had, with<br>
  his collaborator, done the trick. I looked down<br>
  on what I had accomplished. Death closes all :<br>
  but something <mark>ere the end</mark>, some work of<br>
  <mark>noble note</mark>, may yet be done. That figure-<br>
  head beard would plough the <mark>pseudo-scientific<br>
  seas</mark> no more, at least. There had been other<br>
  murders, of course, to-day, and with greater<br>
  consequence. Francis Ferinand’s, for in-<br>
  stance. But never one that had left a man more<br>
  dead. I gave the huddle farewell, and forbade<br>
  Henry, my peerless investigator, to pur-<br>
  sue the matter further. I climbed down<br>
  from the short <mark>flight of folding</mark> steps upon<br>
  which I had secured my inevitable helio-<br>
  graphic record of success. No more by thee<br>
  my steps shall be for ever and for ever.<br>
