    Looking over at the sly sideways smile which<br>
    seemed to fill all the foreground opposite me, I<br>
    could not help recalling old Lord Pentarry<br>
    and his minion. “Tools must be tooled in the<br>
    de Quincey sense,” he had said, as he stood<br>
    wiping the billhook on his smalls, over the<br>
    welter that had once been so incomparable a<br>
    lieutenant. I felt I could not do less. Maturity<br>
    can always be depended on. Ripeness can be<br>
    trusted. Young women are green : I spoke<br>
    horticulturally. My metaphor was drawn from<br>
    fruits. The Scottish nobleman had also spoken<br>
    of a green stick fracture. Green was the name<br>
    of the victim. Those little golden escapes,<br>
    those logical thoughts, came on me like<br>
    stars upon some gloomy grove, as Henry<br>
    said. And then arrived the blinding realis-<br>
    ation that if I did not do the thing myself—
    and I am not that type—I would be<br>
    merely robbing a whirlwind to reap a<br>
    scorpion. I would have to think it over.<br>
