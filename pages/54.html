  I was feeling about as good as man could feel<br>
  that day. Everything horticultural, in the<br>
  awful and literal sense of the word, was<br>
  lovely. Green blood, as I considered even<br>
  before breakfast, I delighted to conserve.<br>
  I received a letter from Miss Doncaster,<br>
  over the crumbs of toast and the last clear<br>
  smear of marmalade, telling me that the old<br>
  man would be coming to-day, on her advice,<br>
  to take mine. I admit that she had stirred me<br>
  strangely. I lit a Nestor and considered her<br>
  letter once more. To <mark>pestle a poisoned poison</mark><br>
  behind his crimson lights. That was a nice<br>
  thing to ask of a comparative stranger. It<br>
  would have to be scanned. Poor old man ;<br>
  but everyone must bump up against his Water-<br>
  loo, and to-day was the day of the meeting at<br>
  La Belle Alliance. It was not inappropriate.<br>
