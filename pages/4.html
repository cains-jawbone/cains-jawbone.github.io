    Maestro Jimson’s title, now that this piled<br>
    abomination is actually before me. But the<br>
    queen can do no wrong. The rain that came<br>
    heavily is drying off lightly. There, jauntily<br>
    tripping from the edge of one puddle to another<br>
    is crisp Sir Roland Mowthalorn, shuddering<br>
    old thing, intent to buy the day’s button-<br>
    hole from gin-faced Annie behind the church.<br>

    into the sea. I turn my head, and see no<br>
    little boy. Perhaps he has already tumbled<br>
    in. In the snowy cumulus above the orange<br>
    there seems to be now a hole. She tells me to<br>
    mash all with a spoon. If she had said a mashie.<br>
    But she is so beautiful. Can I suspect her?<br>
