  I cannot help, even with this supreme distrac-<br>
  tion, thinking of my Babbie’s—dare I say my<br>
  Babbie’s—hair as I last saw it, tiger-coloured,<br>
  and all like the little springs of a fairy’s sofa.<br>
  O toison, moutonnant jusque sur l’encolure!
  O boucles! O parfum chargé de nonchaloir!
  Extase! If you take my meaning. She, at least,<br>
  shows herself delightfully interested in Henry.<br>
  I have always hated that these writers should<br>
  be anonymous. What a tribe of them there has<br>
  been, to be sure! But I have called them all by<br>
  their names. Is it a foolish ecstasy to thrill<br>
  when I see her long warm fingers taking off<br>
  Henry’s cap and putting it on again, and try-<br>
  ing him out on the table? My dear guest accepts<br>
  a Rainbow. I clamour for it, and it comes.<br>
  She explains, and her throat dimples, that<br>
  she will take it because Lent is over. She never,<br>
  she adds, will have a second Sundae in Lent.<br>
  I must be besotted, for I think this amusing.<br>
