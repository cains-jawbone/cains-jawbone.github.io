    I considered that venerable whose winter<br>
    Achilles thought to take from the lips of Cres-<br>
    sida. Why not? I set fire to one end of him,<br>
    gloatingly, and my nerves benefited. Electric<br>
    Febrifuge may be ; but bad for life’s fitful<br>
    fever. Its active ingredient had finally let me<br>
    down. I was nothing if not generous. I started<br>
    my fellow garden enthusiast on the foxgloves.<br>
    He would appreciate that if he knew. Yes, I<br>
    was doing my best for the dear girl. I wished<br>
    I could make up (she would appreciate this) my<br>
    mind about her. If we did decide—and that<br>
    weighed with a girl—she would not have to<br>
    change the initials on her parti-panties. I<br>
    thought of the old spare-room in this very<br>
    house, where Mrs. Gay used to lie upon her<br>
    visits. When I was ill, I was put there, with<br>
    the only dangling bell-wire in all the place,<br>
    descending behind my head. I used of<br>
    course to have nightmares of the Speckled<br>
    Band, and awfully scream down the house.<br>
