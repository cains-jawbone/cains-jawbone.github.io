    I wish she would tell me more. I wish she would<br>
    give me some hint as to why the deceased<br>
    wished us to know each other. Sitting here,<br>
    stung by those wild gold waspish eyes, I wonder<br>
    terribly. I wonder dreadfully. I do think it is a<br>
    pity. Auroral imbibitions have set Alistair on<br>
    young uncertain feet once more, and he’s<br>
    handsomely taken the Dagenham bus en route<br>
    for the converted oast-house where his mother<br>
    lives. I hope it won’t backslide. Barbara passes<br>
    from right to left, dear child. Her one-piece is<br>
    yellow jasmine, and she spurns the concrete<br>
    and especially the abstract with those bronze<br>
    legs of hers. The tawny curls of her are springes<br>
    to catch woodcocks, and more than woodcocks.<br>
    She waves a towel capriciously, take it or leave<br>
    it, at me. What would I do now, if the other<br>
    leaned across and said what the blind sailor<br>
    said? But wiseacres contend that it was<br>
    Kismet. Off went his arm to-day. Yes,<br>
    what would I feel like? She is delightful.<br>
