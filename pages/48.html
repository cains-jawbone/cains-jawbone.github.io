  I had always thought that Tate essentially<br>
  meant sugar. This I liked almost next to<br>
  anything, though mostly not at once, but<br>
  under the gas fire and pulled out when there<br>
  was nobody else. But he said to her, as in the<br>
  game a lot of them played there once, another<br>
  had begun to-day, and had wormed his way<br>
  into the Book of Common Prayer. But I<br>
  didnâ€™t think he would taste so good ; I pre-<br>
  ferred the sugar one. I thought they were<br>
  together much too much. I became convinced<br>
  that I must be a sad dog ; I tried to remember<br>
  all the times when one of the other sex had<br>
  preoccupied me, and we had been oblivious<br>
  of all else. I tried to forgive. He called her Crat-<br>
  aegus Oxyacantha over the cocktails ; that was<br>
  his big joke. I knew it by the way he laughed,<br>
  and I too rolled about. But I liked the real way<br>
  to call her best. I met Ecky that evening, he was<br>
  very happy ; but just about all in. When<br>
  I greeted him he nearly fell on my nose.<br>
