  In one way, of course, I was glad they were<br>
  married. I had always been rather a stickler<br>
  for purity in family life. That scandalous<br>
  rumour of a Maltese landing on our island<br>
  and seducing an ancestress of mine—or was<br>
  it an ancestor?—from the path of duty, I<br>
  never had and never would believe. If I had<br>
  had a real education, instead of just listening<br>
  to him, I could have told—it was bad that<br>
  day—how I detested being called Hal. It was<br>
  she that did it. But he was pleased in a way,<br>
  and said to her, out of a book, the original<br>
  ground of the transaction appears to have<br>
  been sentimental : “He was my friend,”<br>
  says the murderous doctor ; “he was dear to<br>
  me.” Some Tom, not the one I killed in the<br>
  matter of Jasmine, had done that, I gath-<br>
  ered. He was enthusiastic and provided a<br>
  chop for me, and said it was good he had<br>
  visited England to-day for the first time.<br>
