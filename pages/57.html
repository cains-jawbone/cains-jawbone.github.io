      Armadale Castle is also a ruined country house in Armadale, Skye.
      Former home of the MacDonalds. In 1815 a Scottish baronial style
      mock-castle, intended for show rather than defense, designed by James
      Gillespie Graham, was built next to the house.

  that wasn’t the boat that went to South Africa.<br>

    NOTES<br>
    DATE : August 20<br>
    NARRATOR : Henry's dog<br>
    was ben's friend assassinated?<br>
    there's like a really long list of boats in here; i'm not sure you would
    need this many to make a point about boats generally. perhaps it is
    pointing towards a specific reference book? or the boats mentioned are
    codes for something?<br>
