  It seemed from what I heard that Felton’s<br>
  meat had been delivered at Brookesley for<br>
  the first time that day. I wondered if it was<br>
  good and plentiful. Not that I really liked to<br>
  think about meat, though we were alone<br>
  again. I thought it crude of him to talk about<br>
  no noise here, but the toning of a tear, or a<br>
  sigh of such as bring cowslips for her cover-<br>
  ing, until I realised that he was thinking<br>
  that Ben’s friend had been, in point of time,<br>
  like Felton’s meat. Over the Westphalian<br>
  ham, which I contrived to share, he read<br>
  bits of paper about Hilary and the Amazon,<br>
  and Stella Polaris and Voltaire, and the<br>
  City of Nagpur, and Vandyck, and other<br>
  lovely people. I wondered if he wasn’t<br>
  thinking of going on a holiday. It seemed<br>
  a pity to me ; so unnecessary, just then.<br>
  I knew nothing at all about boats. Some<br>
  of my people had known the old Arma-<br>
  dale Castle well enough, doubtless ; but<br>
  that wasn’t the boat that went to South Africa.<br>
