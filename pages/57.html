  It seemed from what I heard that Felton’s<br>
  meat had been delivered at Brookesley for<br>
  the first time that day. I wondered if it was<br>
  good and plentiful. Not that I really liked to<br>
  think about meat, though we were alone<br>
  again. I thought it crude of him to talk about<br>
  no noise here, but the <mark>toning of a tear</mark>, or a<br>
  sigh of such as bring cowslips for her cover-<br>
  ing, until I realised that he was thinking<br>
  that Ben’s friend had been, in point of time,<br>
  like Felton’s meat. Over the Westphalian<br>
  ham, which I contrived to share, he read<br>
  bits of paper about <span class="highlight">Hilary

  thinking of going on a holiday. It seemed<br>
  a pity to me ; so unnecessary, just then.<br>
  I knew nothing at all about boats. Some<br>
  of my people had known the old <span class="highlight">Arma-<br>

      Armadale Castle is also a ruined country house in Armadale, Skye.
      Former home of the MacDonalds. In 1815 a Scottish baronial style
      mock-castle, intended for show rather than defense, designed by James
      Gillespie Graham, was built next to the
      house.

  </span> well enough, doubtless ; but<br>
  that wasn’t the boat that went to South Africa.<br>

    NOTES<br>
    narrator is from Scotland<br>
    there's like a really long list of boats in here; i'm not sure you would
    need this many to make a point about boats generally. perhaps it is
    pointing towards a specific reference book? or the boats mentioned are
    codes for something?<br>
