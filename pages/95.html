    I knew, of course, that if I got there in five<br>
    minutes I would have double the time for my<br>
    by no means suburban hops at the Café
    Royal, without insulting it and myself with<br>
    John Montagu’s arrangement for an uninter-<br>
    rupted session at the gaming table. I felt so<br>
    much at one with <span class="highlight">Holy Mr. Herbert.</span> Or Mr.<br>
    Haddock did he call himself? But he was<br>
    right about these hours, and if that was not<br>
    holiness, what was? Meed kissing laces, surely<br>

    and then drew a sheet of notepaper to-<br>
    wards me. I took up my pen, after having<br>
    laid it down again and again, and, seeing<br>
    that the ink was sufficient, plunged in. In<br>
    clear terse phrase, utterly neglecting my<br>
    contact with his infancy, I told him all,<br>
    hour by hour, day by day, from the incep-<br>
    tion to the culmination of the horrid act.<br>
