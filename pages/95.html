    I knew, of course, that if I got there in five<br>
    minutes I would have double the time for my<br>
    by no means suburban hops at the Café
    Royal, without insulting it and myself with<br>
    John Montagu’s arrangement for an uninter-<br>
    rupted session at the gaming table. I felt so<br>
    much at one with Holy Mr. Herbert. Or Mr.<br>
    Haddock did he call himself? But he was<br>
    right about these hours, and if that was not<br>
    holiness, what was? Meed kissing laces, surely<br>
    he had convulsed us with. For the moment it<br>
    didn’t matter. Because I had decided what to<br>
    do. Leda and Hebe, I gave my swan a drink,<br>

    laid it down again and again, and, seeing<br>
    that the ink was sufficient, plunged in. In<br>

    contact with his infancy, I told him all,<br>
    hour by hour, day by day, from the incep-<br>
    tion to the culmination of the horrid act.<br>
