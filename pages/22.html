      <span class="comment">
        The murder of the De Witts, on the 10th (or 20th?)
        of August 1672, was an atrocity which attracted much attention
        throughout Europe. John and Cornelius de Witt, born at Dort, in
        Holland, were the sons of a burgomaster of that town. The Corpses of
        the De Witt Brothers is a c. 1672–75 oil on canvas painting by the
        Dutch Golden Age painter Jan de Baen

    </span> ; I can’t<br>
    say I understood very much. But I liked his<br>
    name, and showed him so, for he had always<br>
    been very clement to me, even about that cat<br>
    Jasmine. By the bye, Tusitala and Flora had<br>
    both come over to our place. Of course you<br>
    might say that was nothing to make a song<br>
    about. But others had not agreed. And just<br>
    as I was feeling how much I loved him, he put<br>
    on funny clothes and went away. I lowered<br>
    myself and made love to Flora. It was quite<br>
    late when he came back with her. He had<br>
    always told me that I was absurdly sensitive.<br>
    It might be so. Explain it how you will,<br>
    when I first set eyes on her I felt no vibra-<br>
    tion, no hint at all, of my latter end. I<br>
    was banished and slept miserably with Flora.<br>
