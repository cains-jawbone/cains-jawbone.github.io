    </span>, I was told, and Augustus, I<br>
    remembered, was a chubby lad. I was getting<br>
    quite clever in that way. He said his stepson<br>
    had been misunderstood for a long time, and<br>
    had gone out to-day. He said his third son<br>
    had been crude. I did not entirely under-<br>
    stand ; but I had a lot of good Tate. She said<br>
    to him. He said to her. The consequence was<br>
    rather dreadful, but out of doors. I had got a<br>
    little sick, too, of the way they went on ; like<br>
    that Tom and Flora’s Jasmine. Perhaps that<br>
    was really it. They were having their first<br>
    quarrel, about the new distemper. She was all<br>
    for Dark French Grey and he for Egg Shell<br>
    Green. Yet I knew they’d get over that.<br>
    I had. But each, too, began to say things<br>
    about how few the other had done so late<br>
    in the year. I don’t know why, but I felt<br>
    that mice were dancing on my little slab.<br>
