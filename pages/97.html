    To have slept and to wake right up sur-<br>
    rounded by an atmosphere in which Bunny<br>
    and Perry went at it hammer and tongs,<br>
    seemed almost sacrilege. That was the day<br>
    when I was going to do a thing I had never<br>
    done before. I looked at Henry, and felt a<br>
    little sick. I took two pills. I had too soon—
    perhaps I did not want to go even so quickly<br>
    as my ordered slowness—exchanged a tennis<br>
    venue for a rowing one. I was not in Dorset ;<br>
    but I murmured to myself that Ellen Brine<br>
    of Allenburn would never mwore return. The<br>
    connection was obvious. What a day, I thought,<br>
    for the despatch of Paris and Leonidas. Cam-<br>
    bridge or Thermopylae? But Paris? I had<br>
    never at school looked upon him as in any<br>
    sort a healer. I had, infact, never heard of<br>
    John Ayrton then. Ouvre ton âme et ton<br>
    oreille au son de ma mandoline : pour<br>
    toi j’ai fait, pour toi, cette chanson cruelle<br>
    et caline. But I wasn’t thinking of John Ayrton.<br>
