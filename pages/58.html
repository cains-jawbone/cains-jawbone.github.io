  Considering it was my name month, I wasn’t<br>
  having too much luck. Henry, though a bit<br>
  on the spectacular side—to fly the viscera of<br>
  his third, of the old family lawyer, at his<br>
  small flagstaff, a little argued the exhibi-<br>
  tionist—was sane enough. And this stranger,<br>
  to judge by the over-vague conversation he<br>
  began to force on me—different in this from<br>
  the agriculturist, who had been utterly silent<br>
  save for the burning question, and the brats<br>
  who had only uttered mutually—was distinctly<br>
  nuts. Nuts in May, how Freudian. Be not a<br>
  Freud ; thy help is near. But was it? Henry<br>
  was in desperate case, and this other was<br>
  short-sighted enough not to realise that I<br>
  should care. The former was stooping over<br>
  the cooling remains of his fourth—the rash<br>
  intruding charlady—when there came a hor-<br>
  ribly official knock at the little blue door.<br>
  (Was it Inspector Barraclough, or only some<br>
  stolid-witted local?) But little the latter<br>
  cared. He went on talking about Browning.<br>
