    I had seen, day after day, every sunlit or night<br>
    obscured detail of the funny old house I had<br>
    visited so many years ago. Through it, hand-<br>
    some, cadaverous and so quiet, had walked<br>
    Death himself, tapping unnoticed at the very<br>
    walls of the mansions of life ; trying here,<br>
    failing there, lightly fingering for the sign of<br>
    a breach. A tiny opening. Apparently the<br>
    person who slept in the lock-up at that county<br>
    town on the Severn, or perhaps woke, would<br>
    hear this time. I had found that I could face<br>
    my usual mixture of <span class="highlight">Peaberry Mysore and<br>
    Blue Mountain
      <span class="commment">
        coffee from India and the West Indies, respectively
      </span>
    </span>. I had made certain havoc<br>
    of two on toast, their <span class="highlight">silver skins laced with<br>
    their golden blood.

    </span> To think of the tiny<br>
    Clem mixed up, nay, a prime mover, in<br>
    such affairs. Useful, courteous little chip<br>
    of a bat. He had hushed my brat for me<br>
    when he was only six, one morning on<br>
    which I had wanted to go out for a walk.<br>
