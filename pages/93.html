    Had not the author of Wails of a Tayside Inn<br>
    said of them that they were the living poems<br>
    and that all the rest were dead? Had not the<br>
    singer of Wimpole Street said that they were<br>
    binding up their hearts away from breaking<br>
    with a cerement of the grave? Anyway their<br>
    hour had come and was now over ; just but<br>
    emphatically over, and I could not be sorry.<br>
    I knew, after arguing it out from one side of<br>
    my aching head to another—those little Bunny<br>
    and Perry, Pro and Con, had been at it hammer<br>
    and tongs on the centre court between the<br>
    two lobes of my brain—that if I had no<br>
    tangible proof against the erstwhile cleanser<br>
    of my old headgear, I had merely a thistle-<br>
    down of semi-conviction against the other.<br>
    That his thought process, when I tapped<br>
    its wire, had been calling her a Cam-<br>
    bridge week, helped me, surely, not at all.<br>
