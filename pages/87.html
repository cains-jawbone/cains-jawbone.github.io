      Of the old bold mate of Henry Morgan.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="page_story">
      My guest has, I think, a Byzantine beauty, as of<br>
      a golden snake. Is she, or is she not, a little pale<br>
      about the Gills? Sanders comes into view<br>
      again, seemingly improved by his lunar visit.<br>
      He props himself and gazes out to the north-<br>
      west over the water of the little bay, drinking<br>
      it all in. I follow his gaze and see, as Henry<br>
      saw when he was at home in Woodstock,<br>
      twisted trees in front of the thick-windowed<br>
      little house, and a foreground of exquisitely<br>
      coloured vegetation with somewhat the con-<br>
      sistency of fur stoles : a breast of the hills under<br>
      a long cloud. I have given her nothing at all.<br>
      She has let me see the original of the dead<br>
      manâ€™s letter. It is funny, it is rather fearful,<br>
      to feel a wet skeleton hand putting hers into<br>
      mine. Why, I wonder? Not that it can really<br>
      be skeleton yet ; it must be---worse : a<br>
      loathsome mass of detestable putrescence.<br>
