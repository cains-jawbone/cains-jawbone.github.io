      My earlier days had been so different. There<br>
      hadn’t been the comfort, the sense of indul-<br>
      gence, or of adventure, that there was now. I<br>
      bit into the last of the oysters and someone<br>
      carried away the shells. It had been, as I say,<br>
      so different. Cascading down the bombazine of<br>
      my great aunt’s knee, what futility! When all<br>
      her desire had been to give me a lap. What<br>
      frustration of her, and incidentally of myself,<br>
      when to be nursed by her and to submit to<br>
      her stories had meant access to that secret<br>
      caddis-hoard of Devona or of minty humbugs.<br>
      I wondered what Henry would think of next.<br>
      I had plenty of time, my watch said. My<br>
      eyes had groped foolishly at the barren<br>
      moon of the near-by clock, and then fallen<br>
      away. My watch must be my mentor. I felt<br>
      perhaps sillily ready for some sort of cardiac<br>
      revelation, or revaluation at least.<br>

      Yet now my heart leaps, O beloved!
      God’s child with his dew<br>
      On thy gracious gold hair, and those lilies still<br>
      living and blue<br>
