    I discussed certain passages with the man, and<br>
    he was too guardedly ignorant in his contribu-<br>
    tions to our discussion. The chapter on the fall<br>
    of the rupee you may omit. It is somewhat too<br>
    sensational. Even these metallic problems have<br>
    their melodramatic side. But would I have<br>
    called him to me had it not been for money?<br>
    Many a truth had been spoken, I reflected, as<br>
    an epigram. Like something very far away in<br>
    a great disused house, that may to the aching<br>
    ear seem to be lifting a flag in some disused<br>
    second cellar, my suspicion made an escaping<br>
    movement, a movement of birth in a blank<br>
    and distant subterrene of my mind. As I looked<br>
    at him I realised that no single dish would<br>
    satisfy the man. He would be, even to start<br>
    with, for a course of soup, and then another<br>
    of fishes, as my namesake said, and another<br>
    of birds. I have never met any really wicked<br>
    person before. I feel rather frightened. I am<br>
    so afraid he will look just like every one else.<br>
