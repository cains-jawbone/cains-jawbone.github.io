  So far the mind had been ambling, if I may<br>
  dare the expression ; moving forward ungainly,<br>
  as if by one hemisphere at a time. But now I<br>
  keenly wondered how we should agree, myself<br>
  and this well-fed swine that had just been<br>
  introduced to me. He was obviously in drink,<br>
  and none the worse for that : the better indeed<br>
  for my purpose. The old fellow’s face seemed<br>
  vaguely familiar, though I am not good at<br>
  faces. Suddenly I remembered that white<br>
  beard which jutted from his chin like an under-<br>
  curving wave. It should have been recognis-<br>
  able a mile off, from weekly reminders in the<br>
  more ecstatic newspapers, as that of Sir Paul<br>
  Trinder, whose furor loquendi had cause him<br>
  for twenty years to adhere loudly to every<br>
  ebbing cause in town. He was also, if I mistook<br>
  not, some sort of chartered lecturer at ob-<br>
  scure seats, one might almost call them<br>
  stools, of learning. Such a man, it might<br>
  be argued, was no one’s enemy but his own ;<br>
  but, oh, what a bitter enmity that could be.<br>
