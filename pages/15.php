    Now, I considered, in my dear Lyons it would<br>
    be coming of age hours, and I wondered if<br>
    they would ever do that over here. I fancied<br>
    what self-consciousness and preciosity there<br>
    would be, for instance, if the B.B.C. ever took<br>
    it up. A strange institution ; but the nursed fuse<br>
    was always interesting. Yes, if sitting at the<br>
    familiar table with Bart chewing at my<br>
    moccasins, I could have broadcast it all, I<br>
    would have left the mighty heart of England to<br>
    deal with it. On that very day, I recalled, an-<br>
    other terrible thing happened. John Hewit and<br>
    Sarah Drew, just engaged to be married, were<br>
    working together in a field of barley when they<br>
    were both struck by lightning. Alexander,<br>
    the only noteworthy Pope of my native land,<br>
    was demonstrably affected. And my namesake<br>
    wrote a letter, in which he said that Sarah’s left<br>
    eye was injured, and there appeared a black<br>
    spot on her breast. Her lover was all over black ;<br>
    but not the least sign of life was found in either.<br>
