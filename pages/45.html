  It was when that half Pole, half Frenchman,<br>
  and usually up the first half, that self-styled<br>
  drunken mongrel and lazy waster, got normally<br>
  out of bed. I remembered that when Hélène<br>
  told him of her attachment he gave up brandy.<br>
  And took to absinthe. It was one of the times<br>
  that he had an absinthe. They said that it<br>
  made the heart grow fonder. What had I actu-<br>
  ally seen? I had seen Henry—surely I had<br>
  heard him called so—bending innocently over<br>
  an innocent corpse of his own making. And I<br>
  had also seen the doctor leading the old man up<br>
  the garden, not once or twice, but many times.<br>
  The girl was no longer there. I stayed myself<br>
  with devilled Epicam and Royans aux Achard,<br>
  levered into me with Peter Barleys and washed<br>
  down and out, foul thought, with Villa-<br>
  cabras. But one was so helpless alone in<br>
  a great building of many flats : I was glad<br>
  I had not given up stealing at the doors.<br>
