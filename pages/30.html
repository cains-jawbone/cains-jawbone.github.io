    I see that old dandy has purchased Cape<br>
    Jasmine. Your gardenia is difficult at a distance<br>
    to determine. It may be florida flore-pleno,<br>
    double white. Why should I care? I am a very<br>
    sick fellow. Gardenias! And there are also<br>
    Gardener’s Garters, Phalaris arundinacea varie-<br>
    gata. I am not at all well. He is clutched<br>
    unwillingly into greeting old Mrs. Cave, our<br>
    local Dame Quickly. They mince at one<br>
    another. Yes, by James! James? Lo, how<br>
    these fair immaculate women walk behind<br>
    their jocund maker ; and we see slighted De<br>
    Mauves, and that far different she, Gressie,<br>
    the trivial Sphinx. We uncommiserate pass<br>
    into the night from the loud banquet. Sorry. She<br>
    urges me to the American mess. I wolf three-<br>
    quarters, thinking of Quebec. Then I try her<br>
    out, saying, with an airy lift of the spoon, this<br>
    savours not of death, this hath a relish of eter-<br>
    nity. Excellent, my dear Watson. But the leop-<br>
    ard’s eyes do not bat a blink. Can she be guilty?<br>
