    I found myself by that one of the windows<br>
    which overlooked the stone broach spire—a<br>
    rarity in Kent—of Pluckley church, and the<br>
    light would strike my book from over my<br>
    right shoulder. I drew a volume from my<br>
    pocket ; blind-tooled on the green in a double<br>
    circle was a single star above what was perhaps<br>
    a sea. I have had very little experience of it<br>
    myself up to the present. I have only been<br>
    married once. That was in consequence of a<br>
    misunderstanding between myself and a young<br>
    person, and I wondered if such a reason for<br>
    marriage would ever have occurred to me.<br>
    I had never married, and scarcely felt like<br>
    beginning now. It was the tenth edition, of<br>
    1917. No, Sir ; it is not a very interesting<br>
    subject. I never think of it myself. Not a woman<br>
    had entered as yet. I was in for a ticklish<br>
    business, and I knew it. Forging ahead, I sup-<br>
    posed they would call it, since the woman was<br>
    not yet dead. You might not hear of her again.<br>
