    I saw to it that I should be for a moment alone<br>
    among the marigolds. Thinking kindly of those<br>
    two other flowers, which I felt almost certain<br>
    now would win me the girl I felt I could love,<br>
    I exulted. Dear old Gerard, he said it was<br>
    called Calendula as it is to be seene to flower<br>
    in the calends of almost everie month. I<br>
    turned the strong searchlights of my eyes upon<br>
    the orange tinted documents. But I could not<br>
    read them. My eyes, or something, were not<br>
    good enough. And yet I was not among those<br>
    who attempt, ek parergou, to confound eph-<br>
    phatha with epea pteroenta. You would have<br>
    noticed my oriental preference when I smoke,<br>
    and would not have been surprised that my In-<br>
    dian tobacco, after a scant four-and-twenty<br>
    hours, was doing excellent work. It seemed<br>
    almost certain that the blight would be<br>
    destroyed : the blight on the May, or on<br>
    the delight that is as wide-eyed as a marigold.<br>
