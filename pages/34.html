  It was a petty employ for one of my reputation ;<br>
  you would not hear, I felt, much more of it.<br>
  I hope you have not been leading a double life,<br>
  pretending to be wicked and being really good<br>
  all the time. That would be hypocrisy. I have<br>
  spoken of ironic comment. There was, I<br>
  thought, little chance of that. I wondered if he<br>
  had ever been an innocent child feeding among<br>
  the pantries. But that was no fit time for such<br>
  musings. He took foolish occasion to tell me<br>
  who he was ; as if I did not know. Bills should<br>
  always be met squarely. I turned to the man,<br>
  and his gaze soon fell before mine. He had<br>
  always spoken as if his throat were full of jelly.<br>
  Now with a leer, he emitted sounds through<br>
  this quag which shaped themselves into hints at<br>
  some perpetual reward for valuable services ren-<br>
  dered. But even then I had not made up my<br>
  mind. It was, I said to myself, a bad workman<br>
  who could not play one tool against another.<br>
