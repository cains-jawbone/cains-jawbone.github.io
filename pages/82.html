    I forgot why I was sitting and staring at the<br>
    table. I felt battered. What could the batter<br>
    be? Ah, I remembered. I had looked upon<br>
    carnal, bloody and unnatural acts. And then,<br>
    gazing at the steaming Lapsang before me, I<br>
    became lost in reverie. Bartholomew pawed<br>
    my ankles even, but I am not superstitious, to<br>
    ladder danger, desiring sweet biscuits. They<br>
    were so bad for him. He was the third dog I<br>
    had had in London. I was afraid, I realised,<br>
    that I did not notice him enough. It was the<br>
    first dog I noticed, and at the very beginning.<br>
    You might have thought it strange for me<br>
    to say these things, but you never knew<br>
    Henry. Whether as a human mistake or one<br>
    o’ the brand o’ Cain, as the Poet Laureate<br>
    says—and he served in both capacities—
    he knew his job. I felt as if great asses<br>
    of mice were pressing down on my head,<br>
    with all the cold weight of my certainty.<br>
