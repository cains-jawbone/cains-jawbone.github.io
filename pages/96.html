    Now I think I will try a cup of what they<br>
    insolently call Golden Tips, a fine young Tippy<br>
    Tea. And then they say specifically No Tips.<br>
    It is very disheartening. While I am waiting<br>
    for it, and for the possible her, I study the<br>
    only literature before me. What is a Logan-<br>
    berry Kiss? Is it at all like the Plover’s Lunch,<br>
    that hurts and is desired? It is strange to<br>
    think that Catharine is even at this moment<br>
    turning a Somerset in front of the altar. The<br>
    whole business reminds me of the time we<br>
    lay outside Jifjaffa, and the Padre said to me :<br>
    “I would rather have written that poem than<br>
    take castor oil in the morning.” I had been<br>
    reading him my Ode on the Intimations of<br>
    Immorality in Early Childhood. Well, well.<br>
    How vividly, whenever I adventure on stew<br>
    now, I remember the stew we had that night.<br>
    How it all comes back. The whole circum-<br>
    stances of this meeting are so mysterious. It gars<br>
    me grue, if I may be permitted the expression.<br>
