    But next day that religious fellow’s head<br>
    drapery, if I might thus unscientifically express<br>
    myself, showed signs, it seemed to me, after<br>
    that initial success, of failing. I would give it<br>
    till midnight. Do not misunderstand me. Why<br>
    should I not play the Spartan mother with<br>
    emotion, be the Lucius Junius Brutus of my<br>
    kind? I thought of May. Over them came old<br>
    odour of red May. Lovely, indeed, but not<br>
    appropriate. I felt that I was letting May down.<br>
    As for the other, I had, of course, no intention<br>
    of letting up. Henry, before our tea of anchovy<br>
    toast and various hot dishes (I was never a<br>
    stinter) riotously displayed himself all over<br>
    me. He hit me once full in the eye, and<br>
    I remembered, I could not help remem-<br>
    bering, Elsie’s difficulty when the young<br>
    coastguard had tried to prove to her his<br>
    direct descent from Herebald the Drake. “I<br>
    will,” she quoted, “express my duty in his eye.”
