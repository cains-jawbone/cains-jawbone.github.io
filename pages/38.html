  I was feeling better already, and was glad that<br>
  a memory, true though dim, had led me<br>
  to the place. <span class="highlight">Video meliora proboque
    <span class="comment">
      Latin for "I see a better way and approve it, but I follow the worst way." 
      from Ovid's "Metamorphoses"
    </span>
  </span> ; but I<br>
  could not, for all my covert glances, see the<br>
  modelling of the fossettes of the elbows of the<br>
  woman sitting so near me. Were they, I wond-<br>
  ered, like Sonia Gordon’s, triangular dimples<br>
  with shadow in them? Poor Sonia Gordon. I<br>
  pondered on that tragic fortnight at Southend :<br>
  the pier with its electrical railway, and my<br>
  cousin’s rash act, and Sonia’s lapse. Her<br>
  temperament was against her. Still you couldn’t<br>
  have an omelette without breaking eggs. And<br>
  mine was excellent. “You would get off with<br>
  a whole skin, would you?” I cried softly,<br>
  as I stabbed once. And even as I did so, I<br>
  thought of skinny old Marat in his slipper bath,<br>
  the nightcap about his forehead, the dim light<br>
  of the candle, the shadow at the door, the<br>
  stealthy tread of Charlotte Brontë with the<br>
  undulled blade. There was something wrong.<br>
