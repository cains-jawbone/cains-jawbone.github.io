  the darker works of Beardsley and Felicien<br>
  Rops, and ringing with the gloat curses of the<br>
  Head, as we called him, lubriciously gasping<br>
  in the grip of ether. I took the first blink of the<br>
  light at the place of the Whympers. Mrs.<br>
  Allingham painted the fishshop, I remembered,<br>
  and the author of the Land of Mist played<br>
  cricket for it till he went up the hill. I too had<br>
  been struck from the float for ever held in<br>
  solution, I too had received identity by my<br>
  body, that I knew was of my body, and what<br>
  I should be I knew I should be of my body.<br>
  That was a pretty important day, for old Chris<br>
  left Palos on it ; and you all know by this time<br>
  the result of that. But upon my soul I wasnâ€™t<br>
  sure how to celebrate, though celebration was<br>
  one of my specialties. Ought I to allow my-<br>
  self another ration of my herb of grace, and<br>
  sheerly rejoice, or should I merely weep?
  Helen and crooning? Poe and Prohibition?
  Canvas-backed clams and the prejudicial<br>
  Menkin? The balance was too hard to<br>
  strike. In the end I carried on as usual.<br>
