  He was picking round among all she had left<br>
  behind and found a box with his name on it.<br>
  Also it said, for he read it, I always pay my<br>
  debts. Unwrapped, it seemed to be a hundred<br>
  box of Gourdoulis. I had never seen him so<br>
  moved. He started reading a letter from a<br>
  woman, dead the same day. I had yours but<br>
  yesterday, it said, though dated the third of<br>
  February, in which you suppose me to be dead<br>
  and buried. I have already let you know I am<br>
  still alive, he went on, but to say truth, I look<br>
  upon my present circumstances to be exactly<br>
  the same with those of departed spirits. I donâ€™t<br>
  think he ever said any more. Happily I was<br>
  behind the armchair. He just opened the box.<br>
  I had never seen him so moved. There were<br>
  little bits of stuff like black pineapple on the<br>
  carpet. I knew he could never be his old<br>
  collected self again, and that my gray hairs<br>
  would go down in sorrow to the grave.<br>
