    I sit down alone at the appointed table and<br>
    take up my pen to give all whom it may con-<br>
    cern an exact account of what may happen.<br>
    Call me nervous, call me fey, if you will ; at least<br>
    this little pen, this mottled black and silver<br>
    Aquarius, with its nib specially tempered to my<br>
    order in Amsterdam, is greedy. It has not had<br>
    much work since it flew so nimbly for the dead<br>
    old man. As I watch the sea, Casy Ferris passes<br>
    with down-dropped eyes. Of course, to-day is<br>
    the day. Her father reminds me of a valetudi-<br>
    narian walrus. But she has, I suppose, to have<br>
    somebody. St. Lazarus-in-the-Chine is full,<br>
    no doubt, already. I think she is rash ; but it<br>
    is none of my business. Where about the graves<br>
    of the martyrs the whaups are crying, my heart<br>
    remembers how. Strange that he comes into<br>
    my head so much to-day. I hope itâ€™s over some<br>
    flotsam fish that the birds are making whau-<br>
    pee. But all the nice gulls love a sailor. Ugh.<br>
