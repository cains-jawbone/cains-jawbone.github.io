    I sit down alone at the appointed table and<br>
    take up my pen to give all whom it may con-<br>
    cern an exact account of what may happen.<br>
    Call me nervous, call me fey, if you will ; at least<br>
    this little pen, this mottled black and silver<br>
    Aquarius, with its nib specially tempered to my<br>
    order in Amsterdam, is greedy. It has not had<br>
    much work since it flew so nimbly for the dead<br>
    old man. As I watch the sea, Casy Ferris passes<br>
    with <mark>down-dropped</mark> eyes. Of course, to-day is<br>
    the day. Her father reminds me of a valetudi-<br>
    narian walrus. But she has, I suppose, to have<br>
    somebody. <span class="highlight">St. Lazarus
