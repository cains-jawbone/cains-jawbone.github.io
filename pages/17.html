    I am conveniently situated, with the Moon on<br>
    the one hand and the Dawn on the other.<br>
    Conveniently situated for some things, that is.<br>
    Here’s young Sawnie, for instance, parking his<br>
    Fordor with a perfectly grey face. I’m sorry.<br>
    He is fumbling with the lock arrangement. I’ve<br>
    never tried the stuff myself ; bad for the hand.<br>
    He’s visiting the Moon for the first time to-day<br>
    and just the first. I almost wish I had tried the<br>
    Lapsang. I remember I once received seven<br>
    pounds of Lapsang from Grace. Or the Moning,<br>
    very choice, delicate flavour. Why go to pubs?<br>
    There would be no Moning at the bar. Yes,<br>
    there’s Kate Somerset, looking actually proud.<br>
    And that must be he. Poor child. Ah, here she<br>
    is. She slips like a blonde lily into the chair<br>
    opposite. My heart turns over a little in my<br>
    breast and then re-settles. She is very beautiful.<br>
    Why should I think her beauty somewhat sinis-<br>
    ter? Because, perhaps, marriage is in the air?<br>
