    The girl had left Henry by this time, thank<br>
    God. She was an obvious whey-face. She<br>
    didn’t seem capable for a moment of under-<br>
    standing those first two killings of his. He was<br>
    being a dear. He had sent the rector’s aunt<br>
    away, as he explained to the girl, like a bee<br>
    with a sore bonnet. A foreign touch. Killing<br>
    time, yes. I was doing that. It was funny how<br>
    idly the mind worked ; or seeming idly.<br>
    Perhaps there was something in heredity<br>
    after all. I pondered to its direction. An<br>
    accent was a terrible thing, I thought. Killing<br>
    time wouldn’t be so good. I realised that I<br>
    was impressionable, that I liked a good<br>
    murder. But Hodge, once settled, wasn’t in<br>
    the least like a singer. He had a wen, and<br>
    scratched his left whisker. I supposed it would<br>
    be different to suddenly develop a wen for<br>
    someone. Different and messier. He asked me<br>
    about Ben Wade, hitherto merely mutely un-<br>
    employed, and of course I said the right thing.<br>
