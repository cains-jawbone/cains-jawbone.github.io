    Hospitality, when I came to consider it, was<br>
    indeed a funny thing. I wanted to do my best<br>
    for this hopeful newcomer. My cellar, my<br>
    library, my curious collection of bottled worms ;<br>
    all should be at his disposition. He was pathetic-<br>
    ally eager. And at the same time, of course, I<br>
    wanted to do my best for May. I showed him<br>
    nearly everything, and he commended all he<br>
    saw. “You do infinite honour to my little<br>
    home, Sir Paul,” I said. An old fellow who<br>
    would be young again! He had only come<br>
    before lunch ; but there was not time like the<br>
    present. If it be not now, I somewhat foolishly<br>
    said to Henry, who gave a slack ear to me, yet<br>
    it will be. I am not incautious. Determining<br>
    first to exhibit aconitum, I asked him to take<br>
    a preliminary glass of sherry. Flemming’s<br>
    tincture might, and indeed has been, mis-<br>
    taken for this. He drank my health. He<br>
    tasted love with half his mind, nor ever drank<br>
    the inviolate spring where nighest heaven.<br>
