  The cardinal was acquitted to-day of all<br>
  complicity in the affair of the Queen’s diamond<br>
  necklace. How quickly the quicksands of crime<br>
  got hold of the mind’s feet. At that moment it<br>
  seemed incredible that I had ever been an<br>
  innocent child, gambolling among the daisies,<br>
  and thinking, if I thought of it at all, that the<br>
  grave would be as little as my bed. The door<br>
  opened and shut. From what I already knew<br>
  of the man who entered, I should have supposed<br>
  cleaner limbs and an air more sinister. I<br>
  explained my object, and told him to sit down<br>
  and make himself comfortable with the papers.<br>
  Coffee and sandwiches of Westphalian ham<br>
  pleased him too obviously. Why cucumber<br>
  sandwiches? Why such reckless extrava-<br>
  gance in one so young? Yes, I felt, at my<br>
  first sight of him, that the words before<br>
  my eyes would form some sort of commen-<br>
  tary, ironic perhaps, page after page, till<br>
  the end of my interview, and even after.<br>
